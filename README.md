# C++ Algorithm Benchmark

This project is designed to implement and benchmark a specific algorithm using C++. It consists of a main file that serves as the entry point, along with separate files for the algorithm's implementation and its interface.

## Project Structure

```
cpp-algorithm-benchmark
├── src
│   ├── main.cpp          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── algorithm.cpp     # Implementation of the algorithm
│   └── algorithm.h       # Header file for the algorithm
├── Makefile              # Build instructions
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile all the `.cpp` files in the `src` folder and create an executable in the root directory.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the executable with the following command:

```
./cpp-algorithm-benchmark
```

## Algorithm Details

This section will provide details about the specific algorithm being implemented and benchmarked. You can include information about its purpose, complexity, and any relevant references or resources.

## Benchmarking

Instructions on how to benchmark the algorithm can be added here, including any specific metrics or tools used for the benchmarking process.
